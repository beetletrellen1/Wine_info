## About
Looking to build a reasonable predictor where I can take a look at basic language used to describe wine and determine the best wines using these features.  

### Current status
Currently I have put together a web scraper to search a specific wine ratings company.

### Future
- Build the prediction engine to learn from the words describing the wines
- Gather information from weather forecast systems to learn what weather makes the best wines
- Determine if sham wine tasters
- Build a program to help people enjoy the wine more based on characteristics they enjoy.
